* Install
  Package install scripts for various installers.
** Usage
   To install all packages[fn:1] your OS supports[fn:2]:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
./all-packages # you likely will be asked for your password
   #+END_SRC

   To install /only/ packages not requiring a GUI:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
./all-packages cli
   #+END_SRC

   To install packages for a specific installer:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
./for-installer <installer> [cli]
   #+END_SRC

   To see which installers are supported, look at the executable scripts in your
   OS' folder, and the =common/= folder.
* Footnotes

[fn:1] Installs OS-specific packages first, because those might install more
package managers.

[fn:2] All install scripts get package names from a file named after themselves
in the nearby =package-names/= folder.
